IgnitionUnit
============

IgnitionUnit for Water Rockets.

IgnitionUnit is a project, which was developed using an Arduino Micro/UNO. It's aim is to provide an automatic release of a parachute for a water rocket. The parachute is released by a mechanical system using a servo motor. With an barometric pressure sensor (Sparkfun's BMP180) one is able to determine the altitude. After reaching the apogee of the rockets trajectory the servo motor releases the parachute at a certain threshold below the apogee.

Who we are
----------

We are some german students, who are part of a foundation (Hector-Seminar). In april 2014, we traveled for three days to the DLR („Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt“) to develop the automatic release of a parachute for a water rocket. Our aim was its safety landing.
